# Space-X-Falcon9-First-Landing-Prediction

### Project background
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.

In this capstone, I am a data scientist working for a new rocket company named “Space Y” that would like to compete with SpaceX. My responsibilities is to determine the price of each launch by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards. also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage by training a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage
